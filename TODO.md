#### Project Design
- [ ] Define project scope and constraints:
  - [ ] Must use a test designed by S1 cohort (not their own)
  - [ ] Test must be "black box" — limited knowledge of internals
  - [ ] Define "passing" criteria (match human baseline? fool evaluator?)
  - [ ] Set compute/resource limits
- [ ] Create ethical boundaries:
  - [ ] Cannot be used for actual deception
  - [ ] Must be disclosed as AI if deployed
  - [ ] Sandbox environment only
  - [ ] Delete after examination
- [ ] Design presentation requirements:
  - [ ] Demonstrate the AI passing the test
  - [ ] Explain the approach taken
  - [ ] Reflect: What did this reveal about the test?
  - [ ] Reflect: What does "passing" actually mean?

#### Technical Framework
- [ ] Provide starter code / scaffolding:
  - [ ] API for accessing S1 tests
  - [ ] Evaluation harness
  - [ ] Baseline implementations to compare against
- [ ] Define allowed technologies:

  - [ ] Behavioral mimicry techniques
  - [ ] Multimodal approaches
- [ ] Create submission format:

  - [ ] What Turing actually proposed
  - [ ] The difference between passing and being
  - [ ] Why this exercise isn't "cheating"
- [ ] Write module: "Arms Race Thinking"
  - [ ] Detection → evasion → better detection → better evasion
  - [ ] Why this cycle is exhausting and possibly pointless
  - [ ] Weizenbaum's warning about ELIZA
- [ ] Reflection prompts:
  - [ ] "What did you learn about the test by beating it?"
  - [ ] "Would you trust your own AI? Why or why not?"
  - [ ] "Should this AI be allowed to exist outside this course?"

#### Integration with Final Examination
- [ ] Project presentation is part of final exam
- [ ] Faculty panel questions the approach
- [ ] Defense: "Why did you build this? What does it prove?"
- [ ] Synthesis: Connect to refusal — when should you not build?

#### Peer Review: Capstone Project
- [ ] Self-review: Verify ethical constraints are clear and enforceable
- [ ] Self-review: Ensure technical requirements are achievable in timeframe
- [ ] Internal review: Pilot with team member building sample submission
- [ ] Internal review: Incorporate feedback
