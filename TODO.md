#### Concept 1: Eye Reflection
- [ ] Write final prompt:
  ```
  A close-up portrait shot of a person's eye, extreme detail, 
  reflecting neon city lights and rain. The iris contracts as 
  if responding to an unseen question. Blade Runner cinematography, 
  anamorphic lens flares, teal and orange color grading. Rain 
  streaks down glass in foreground. Subtle scan lines. The eye

#### Concept 2: CRT Monitor

  ```
  A vintage CRT monitor displays scrolling text "VOIGHT-KAMPFF 
  TEST IN PROGRESS" in green phosphor. Camera slowly pushes in. 
  Reflections of a human face barely visible in the glass. Dark 
  room, single desk lamp, smoke in the air. 1980s technology 
  aesthetic. The text glitches briefly. Portrait 9:16, cinematic.

- [ ] Download final version

#### Concept 3: Tears in Rain
- [ ] Write final prompt:
  ```
  Rain falls on a face in extreme close-up, water droplets

  artificial? Eyes that have seen things you wouldn't believe. 
  Blade Runner cinematography, night, wet streets reflected in 
  skin. Slow motion. Portrait 9:16, cinematic 4K.
  ```
